# stateful-sessions

An extraction of the stateful-sessions code from Brenton Ashworth's seemingly abandoned sandbar library.  I had previously used sandbar in some of my projects but could not easily release and tag those projects with maven due to the sandbar dependency being a SNAPSHOT version.  Also, the dependencies being used by sandbar were older versions of ring, hiccup, etc.  So, I factored out the parts I needed.  The same copyright (Eclipse) applies as the original work by Mr. Ashworth.  Use as is and at your own risk.  Improvements are welcome.
